      <description>Over the years I have been collecting the aliases that makes sense for me, and by that I really mean makes sense for me :) I might have lost a few recently when I had to reinstall my laptop after a complete crash, but below you will find those I have recovered and remember to have been using quite a bunch.
Common actions st - status -sdh - diff HEADaa - add -Acm - commit -mups - commit -a --amendBranches co - checkoutcob - checkout -bpur = pull --rebase originLog This part is mostly different views on logs, honestly I&amp;rsquo;m not sure it would make sense for anyone but me.</description>
