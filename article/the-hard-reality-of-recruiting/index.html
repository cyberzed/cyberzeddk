        <p>I&rsquo;ve always enjoyed being part of the recruitment process at the different companies that I&rsquo;ve worked for over the years. It&rsquo;s been an absolute pleasure seeing new faces showing up and giving their best indications of why you should hire them.</p>
<p>Applicants have come in many versions, those who write awesome applications, some that don&rsquo;t even bother writing an application, some that are super nervous and those who are way more confident than their skills can carry.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve spent hours discussing the hiring process with my peers, and there is not magic solution to apply to every process. Just like every other process based flow it all depends on who shows up, how much of a hurry you are in, what&rsquo;s the current work load in the team that needs a new hire etc.</p>
<p>One important part of the whole flow is if the applicant has a matching culture, and as one of my leads said at a point to check and applicant&hellip;&ldquo;are you a decent human being at least&rdquo;.</p>
<h2 id="applying">Applying</h2>
<p>There are many different ways of applying for a job, from what you send to the potential future workplace to what crazy form you as a potential employer set up for the applicants. As the market is in Denmark in 2020/2021 there is a huge gap between open positions and proper candidates. Even before 2020 I&rsquo;ve spent so much time of finding/inspiring proper applicants, it&rsquo;s not easily done when you look around other companies in the same area as you are in. Some are inspired by a huge salary, some are inspired by specific technology and some are more intrinsic driven by being sold a good vision.</p>

<p>Good/Bad</p>
<hr>
<p>How do you deem who&rsquo;s the perfect fit or at least the best fit if you can&rsquo;t find that single unicorn? is it the tech knowledge or is it the culture that is more important&hellip;or both perhaps? &#x1f914; Do you run them in a gauntlet that includes code review, code challenges, personality tests (or behavior test if you prefer that wording)?</p>
<p>The first interviews I was sitting in on I was the tech-BS checker, mostly as the hiring manager had no tech knowledge and didn&rsquo;t wanna be overrun by someone who knew buzzwords but not the meaning. I didn&rsquo;t get much to say if I liked the applicant or not as I wasn&rsquo;t gonna sit in a team when the person. It was a huge ego-booster sitting there all smartypants with the option of breaking down a poor nervous applicant, but luckily I didn&rsquo;t roast anyone that didn&rsquo;t set them self up for failure&hellip;and I&rsquo;ve never intended to have anyone leaving with me being a complete douche.</p>
<p>As time (and companies) went by I started having a say in the personality part as well, mostly because the different companies had different approaches to recruiting and peer feedback. I love reading people and spotting warning signs, not to deny an applicant but more in the context of being aware of where that candidate might need some extra attention. I&rsquo;ve sat with an applicant that had no idea why he was applying for this specific job, he just wanted a job&hellip;he didn&rsquo;t get that at the place I worked though.</p>
<p>At my time at iPaper I was the hiring manager which set me in the lead chair of choosing the person to be hired, and boy have that given me a lot of views on applications and applicants. Sadly I&rsquo;ll have to state that applications is a dying breed, even if we were using to upload fields for application and resume/CV people would just throw a LinkedIn generated CV in both uploads. That to me is sad as I love to read a good application as it shows quite a few things about an applicant. If you write that you are very systematic (which I&rsquo;d prefer for a developer) you can&rsquo;t hand in an unorganized mess of an application with typos and structure. Am I being picky here? I&rsquo;d say absolutely not as this is one of the underlying features of that applicant. You don&rsquo;t have to write a dissertation on 20 pages, but one good page is expected and it shouldn&rsquo;t be an ego-booster on what you know. Key points I look for in an application is who you are, what do you know, how aware are you of what you don&rsquo;t know (see it as locating yourself on the Dunning-Kruger graphs with Mount Stupid) and very important how does your life look when you aren&rsquo;t working.</p>
<p>Why do I care about what an applicant does outside of working?</p>
<p>The whole idea of knowing the person is figuring out if you are a dieharder that just want a job or you are looking for a place to be working while enjoying time with your colleagues. It&rsquo;s not a matter of building a social club, but it&rsquo;s so darn important for team dynamics that you aren&rsquo;t completely opposite.</p>
<hr>
<p>Do you get the best result looking at the tech knowledge, looking at the culture of the applicant,
throwing them through a gauntlet of personality and code tests? Is there even a definitive answer to this?</p>
<p>The first interviews I was sitting in on was pretty much as a tech checker, mostly challenging the applicant a bit on what he meant when he said X, Y and Z,
I didn&rsquo;t have that much saying if I liked the applicant or not.
This is a nice and easy beginning when you feel confident in what you are doing, and you know your basics!
This is pretty darn easy, and at some point you&rsquo;ll most likely realize that you meet a lot of applicants that have no idea what they are talking about,
but they are very good at writing applications and getting their way to interviews&hellip;maybe even good and chit-chatting with everyone.
On the other hand you will also meet quite a few people that are really clever that you wise to have as a colleague. AWESOME!</p>
<p>Later on I progressed into being part of a sort of a massive setup on interviewing applicants, honestly it was bit of a crazy setup for a
first round interview when I was going through it myself. I showed up and had gotten a heads up that there were gonna be some of my potential future colleagues.
Reality hits and I ended up in a room with the guy in charge of recruitment, three owners of the company and nothing less than 6 developers from the company.
You can have all of the confidence in your abilities, but if that isn&rsquo;t a bit of a chock on a first round interview I don&rsquo;t know what is :)
Fortunately for most applicants it wasn&rsquo;t that crazy for all, usually the guy in charge of recruitment would have a short coffee chat,
and he would then invite for a second round with most likely 3-4 developers tagging along. The system worked quite fine with the applicant being asked
to describe a system he had been working on, in however abstract manner the applicant liked. Often we could instantly spot how well the candidate was a fit
for our consultancy. One big flaw in that system was that it wasn&rsquo;t quite technical which lead to us accepting quite a few that wasn&rsquo;t really that good at developing
but they were really nice people and fitted well with the culture.</p>
<p>With those experiences in mind I recruited a few people from 2017 to 2021 at <a href="https://ipaper.io">iPaper</a> in my period as CTO. I used some parts of my previous experience
combined with other formats that I had heard of or how it was done before I started in the company.</p>
