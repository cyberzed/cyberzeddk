      <description>Over the years I have been collecting the aliases that makes sense for me, and by that I really mean makes sense for me :) I might have lost a few recently when I had to reinstall my laptop after a complete crash, but below you will find those I have recovered and remember to have been using quite a bunch.
Common actions st - status -s dh - diff HEAD aa - add -A cm - commit -m ups - commit -a --amend  Branches co - checkout cob - checkout -b pur = pull --rebase origin  Log This part is mostly different views on logs, honestly I&amp;rsquo;m not sure it would make sense for anyone but me.</description>
